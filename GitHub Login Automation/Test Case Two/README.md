- Use the WebDriver to input the valid password.
5. Click Login Button:
- Locate the login button using its HTML identifier.
- Use the WebDriver to click the button to submit the login form.
6. Wait for Navigation:
- Implement a wait to ensure the page loads and navigates to the userâ€™s GitHub homepage.
7. Navigate to Repositories Page:
- Locate the "Repositories" tab or link on the homepage.
- Use the WebDriver to click on the "Repositories" link to navigate to the repositories list.
8. Retrieve Repository List:

## Expected Outcome
- The user should be successfully logged into GitHub.
- The repositories page should display a list of the user's repositories.
- At least one repository should be retrieved successfully with correct details.
