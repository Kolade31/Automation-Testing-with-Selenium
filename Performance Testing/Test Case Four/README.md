## Test Case
Performance Under Load Test
## Test Case ID
TC-004
## Description
This test case evaluates the performance of a web application by simulating multiple concurrent requests to a single URL. The goal is to measure the load times and assess how well the application handles high traffic.
## Preconditions
- The performance testing script is set up and ready to run.
- The target URL is known to be valid and accessible.
- The testing environment can handle multiple concurrent connections.
- Internet connection is stable.
## Input
- URL: [Zikoko](https://www.zikoko.com)
- Number of Concurrent Users: 5 (can be adjusted as needed)
## Steps
- Start the performance testing script.
- Input the target URL into the script.
- Set the desired number of concurrent users for the test.
- Execute the test, which should simulate concurrent requests to the URL:
- For each concurrent user, record the start time before loading the page.
- Load the webpage.
- Collect and log the load times for each request.
- Calculate and log the average load time across all requests.
- Observe any errors or timeouts during the test.
## Expected Outcome
- The script should successfully load the URL for all concurrent requests without errors.
- Load times for all requests should be recorded and displayed.
## Postconditions
- All load times are saved in a summary log for analysis.
- The script should handle potential failures gracefully, providing error messages for any requests that fail to load.
## Notes
- Monitor server performance and resource utilization during the test to evaluate how the application handles high traffic.
- Consider running the test multiple times to gather average load times for reliability.
## Actual Results
The script successfully loaded the URL for all concurrent requests without errors and load times for all requests was recorded and displayed
## Status
PASS
